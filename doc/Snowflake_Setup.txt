Data Vault Python Framework

Database installation guide

Deployment to an empty PostgresSQL instance
Most database objects will be deployed by the jobs which need them. 
Nevertheless, some basic elements are necessary to enable the jobs to 
connect and work. This guide explains how to deploy them:

1. Connect to the DB Instance as DBA (mostly user "postgres")
   
2. Install users by adapting passwords and executing following scripts in
    /resources/ddl_pg/database_creation/users
   
   - owner_dwh.sql
   - process_user_metadata.sql
   - process_user_raw_vault.sql
   - process_user_business_vault.sql
   - process_user_mart_general.sql
   - access_role_mart_general.sql
   - access_role_monitoring.sql
   
3. Proceed with /resources/ddl_pg/database_creation/create_database.sql
   
   - Modify tablespace and database name if necessary
   - Execute

4. add pgcyprto extention to public schema
    - select the schema "public" in the new data base
    - execute: CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
   
5. Connect to the DB Instance as "owner_dwh"
   
6. Create the basic schemas by executing from /resources/ddl_pg/
   
   - database_creation/schema_STAGE_RVLT.sql
   - database_creation/schema_STAGE_BVLT.sql
   - monitoring/schema_MONITORING.sql
   - metadata/schema_MONITORING.sql

7. Grant the required permissions to the users by executing  from /resources/ddl_pg/database_creation/users/
   
   - grant_schema_defaults_basics.sql
   - grant_schema_defaults_generic.sql

8. set configuration for direct python execution
   - copy directory "/config_template"  as "/config"  in the root of the project (config is ignored by git repo)
   - modify the connection_pg.ini to contain all correct passwords an users
   - modify the "dvf.ini" : "ddl_root_path" to contain the full path to the resources/ddl_pg directory
   
9. run lib/cimtjobinstance.py
   This will establish the "metadata" schema and "job_instance_status" table including some sample data in the databased
 
10. run  processes/jobless_deployment/__main__.py
   This will deploy all basic udf functions an the monitoring schema to the database
   
   You are ready to run

For a first check, if everything is place, run processes/zzDemo/zzDemo_aaa_p1/__main__.py
This should create a zzsource_demo and a zz_rvlt_demo schema including tables and should populate it with data.
